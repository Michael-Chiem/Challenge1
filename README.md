Michael Chiem has made modifications to the code of this website. 

I have labeled the images to enhance accessibility for screen readers. Additionally, I have provided descriptions for the collectors to improve the troubleshooting process.

I optimized the HTML file by eliminating extraneous code, substituting div elements with semantic HTML, and restructured it to improve the overall flow of content. Rigorous testing was conducted, and the refined code has been successfully.
